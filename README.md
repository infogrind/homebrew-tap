# Infogrind's Homebrew Tap

Most of these are pretty simple scripts and probably not of great use to anyone
other than me. I've just created my own tap and added them here so that I can
install them more easily via homebrew on my home and work MacBooks. So
basically, this is my private repository.

## Installation

To set up:

    brew tap infogrind/tap

Afterwards, simply install the available Formulae like you would any other using
`brew install <formula>`.

Available Formulae:

* `allflac2mp3` - On-the-fly conversion of flac files to mp3
* `fullpath` - Show full path of any file or directory
* `imdbtag` - Quickly and easily rename downloaded movie files using TMDb (not IMDb!) lookup
* `massrename` - Mass-rename files using regular expressions
* `videoinfo` - Display video stream info (codec)
